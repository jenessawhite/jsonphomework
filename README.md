##Reddit, JQuery and JSONP

This is a quick and clean example on how to use JSONP to load data from other servers without any authentication.
This particular example allows users to load the most recent 25 posts from any subreddit that they choose.

JSONP is a great quick way to pull some available data without too many hoops to jump through. However when using JSONP be aware that this hack is at the leniency of the API/data provider and there could be some security concerns.
